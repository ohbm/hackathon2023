By refining the tool's functionality, we can streamline the conversion process and improve the usability of Heudiconv for researchers around the world.\n- **Collaboration and knowledge exchange**: Collaborating with others to improve Heudiconv will foster a productive exchange of ideas and knowledge. The aim is to learn from others while contributing to the community's growth and development.\n- **Improving documentation**: A well-documented tool is an easily accessible tool. By focusing on improving Heudiconv's documentation, the goal is to make the tool more approachable and useful to both new and existing users.\n- **Increasing community engagement**: The project aims to engage more members of the neuroimaging community with the Heudiconv tool. By working on enhancements, we can encourage more researchers to use and contribute to the tool in the future.",

It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation and a friendly community. It includes applications such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), decoding, predictive modelling, functional connectivity, and brain parcellations. In recent years, we have developed functionality to support working with surfaces and we now have concrete plans for extending surface support in Nilearn in order to extend this functionality. To this end, we aim to get contributors to get familiar with the existing surface functionality and to work on issues to improve the surface module and surface plotting functions.\n## GOALS FOR THE BRAIN HACK\nContributors are encouraged to work on issues in the project board by opening pull requests. These include good first issues that will help first time contributors get started and also issues relating to surface functionality.

Through the power of particle ~explosions~ animations, our project aims to shed light on the hidden wonders of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by explo~d~ring the intricacies of k-space and its relationship to the Fourier transform and brain images. Our ultimate goal is to create an enchanting video that unveils the magic of k-space sampling patterns and sparks curiosity among viewers.\nThe primary objective of this project is to leverage particle animations to provide insights into the journey of traveling and sampling the k-space. By generating captivating visualizations, we aim to demystify the concept of k-space and the role it plays in MRI, engaging both the scientific community and the general public in a delightful exploration of this fundamental aspect of imaging.\n## Goals\n- _Particle Animation Wizardry:_ We will create an array of animated particles that represent the journey within the k-space. These particles will travel, interact, and dynamically respond to the sampling process, offering a visually captivating representation of the Fourier transform in action.\n- _K-Space ~Explosion~ Sampling Patterns:_ Through manipulation of the animated particles, we will generate various k-space sampling patterns that demonstrate the importance of sampling strategies in MRI. By altering particle behavior, density, and distribution, we will illustrate the impact of different sampling schemes on image quality and resolution.\n- _Video Compilation:_ The generated particle animations and k-space sampling patterns will be compiled into a visually stunning and informative video. This video will showcase the beauty and complexity of the k-space journey, making it accessible to a wide audience. To reach a broad community of researchers and enthusiasts, we will publish the final video on YouTube. This platform will enable us to share the captivating visuals, educate viewers about k-space and the Fourier transform, and spark curiosity and discussions around the fascinating world of MRI.",

    "goals": "Besides `BIDS`' success, expansion, and description of multiple data modalities, gaps still exist in developing the standard to effectively support the process of scientific results reporting. Among others, this prominently refers to data obtained through and during connectivity analyses. This comprises brain parcellations, connectivity maps, structural and functional connections, major white matter tracts, diffusion signal models, white matter tractograms and tractometry, as well as networks based on dimensionality reduction. Sharing processed data and features in addition to raw and minimally-processed data is critical to accelerating scientific discovery. This is because substantial effort, software, and hardware instrumentation, and know-how are required to bring raw data to a usable state. The aim of the present project is to extend the BIDS standard to encompass derivatives resulting from experiments related to macroscopic brain connectivity (U.S. National Institutes of Health NIMH R01-MH126699). During the Brainhack, we would like to\n1. Gather feedback from experts, users, tool developers, ie everyone!\n2. Work on the respective [BEPs](https://pestillilab.github.io/bids-connectivity/scope_approach/)\n3. Convert `BEP`s from `GoogleDocs` to `GitHub` `PR`s",

    "twiter": "Hi! The FSuB-Extractor is a tool that enables users to extract and analyze white matter bundles based on their intersection with gray matter functional ROIs. This approach has been used to study **f**unctional **su**b-components of **b**undles (FSuB) that support certain cognitive and perceptive tasks [(e.g., Kubota et al., 2022, _Cerebral Cortex_)](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/33/6/2485/6603928).\nRight now we have a functioning workflow, but we would like to formalize it more by migrating our workflow to something like Pydra or Nipype, and set up a software container and continuous integration workflow. We would also like to have outputs that follow BIDS as much as they can (keeping in mind the BIDS derivatives conventions -including connectivity derivatives- are still being codified). Even if you are unexperienced with contributing to code bases, we would still greatly appreciate feedback from beta testers!\nPlease contact me if you are interested or have questions!",
