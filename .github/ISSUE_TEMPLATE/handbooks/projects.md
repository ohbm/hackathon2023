# OHBM Brainhack 2023 Project handbook

## Project submission

You can then submit a project [here]([https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2022/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=Hackathon+Project&template=hackathon-project-form.yml&title=%3CMy+Project+Name%3E](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2023/issues/new?labels=Hackathon+Project&projects=&template=hackathon-project-form.yml&title=%3CMy+Project+Name%3E)).

We will ask you to provide some information about your project in order to advertise it and help onboarding new members.

If you have any questions on the way of submitting your project, feel free to open a general issue to ask any question.


This handbook includes more information on each item.

### Hubs

The OHBM Brainhack 2023 will be in Montreal in person, but will also have [3 online hubs](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2023/schedule/):
- Asia, Pacific
- Europe, Middle East, Africa
- Americas (the same time zone as Montreal)

Your project could have leaders in multiple hubs, but the project pitch will be given just once in the main hub (please note that some sessions will be shared with other hubs, check the schedule for details)


### Link to project

If your project involves code we recommend using a public repository (e.g. GitHub).

If your project does not involve coding, please include a link to the relevant documentation
(e.g. shared online document, space on the open science framework, etc.).

The repository should have [README.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) containing:
-   project idea and context;
-   installation guidelines if applicable;
-   links to further reading/tutorials;
-   and if you want, additional files such as [Contributors.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), to specify which types of people can contribute how.

### Goals

Try to describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack.

If your project is just starting it might simply be "discuss, set up a roadmap, and identify potential obstacles".

For some other projects it could be a set of **SMART** goals:
-   Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
-   Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
-   Achievable (agreed, attainable).
-   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
-   Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

To keep track of the progress on the 2 issues of your project and all the sub-tasks you might use a kanban board.

A kanban board helps you manage your work in a very visual way: here is a short [video explaining the
idea](https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/).

You can use the integrated kanban on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) or use an external app like [trello](https://trello.com/).


### Good first issues

If you have set up a repository for your code, it would be great if you open at least 2 `good first issues`
issues that describe the goals you would like to achieve in this brainhack.

Some examples:
-   improve documentation or tutorial for a package
-   fix an easy to truck bug
-   add tests for specific features



### Onboarding: skills

List skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. Skills can include coding skills and non-coding skills.

#### Non-coding skills

Think in particular about what different types of contributions could be?

It is not all about coding! Are you interested in collaborating with someone with a good flair for
good visualization? Someone with more experience who can make a good user interface? Someone who
knows how to develop good, tidy and clear documentation?

### Communication

During the hackathon we will be using [Discord](https://discord.com/), please download the client and join [OHBM space](https://discord.com/invite/qUzW56dZT2). The channel for your project will be created automatically.

If you run the project online or hybrid, after the project kick-off, you should suggest the time of the meeting on your Discord channel.
It would be great if you plan one daily video meetings with your team members.

If you are in Glasgow, please be open to online contributors and monitor the discord channel!



### Credit and onboarding

How would your project onboard new members with different skillsets -- physicist/imager/clinician/psychologist/computational
scientist/maker/artist/lawyer -- as a project collaborator?

We recommend that you read through Mozilla Open Leadership material on
[personas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and [contribution guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).

If you want to easily list contributors on your repository you can look into the [all contributors bot](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot).



### Twitter-size summary of your project pitch
During the project pitch session, we will tweet about your project. Our default tweet will be as follows:

```
Title
Repo URL
Project leader Twitter handle
#OHBMHackathon #Brainhack #OHBM2022
```

Please provide a twitter-sized summary of your project if you would like us to tweet that insteas of title.
